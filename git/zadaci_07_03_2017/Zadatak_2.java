		 * (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a
		 * class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
		 * Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name,
		 * address, phone number, and email address. A student has a class
		 * status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as
		 * a constant. An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use
		 * the MyDate class defined in Programming Exercise 10.14 to create an
		 * object for date hired. A faculty member has office hours and a rank.
		 * A staff member has a title. Override the toString method in each
		 * class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name. Draw the UML
		 * diagram for the classes and implement them. Write a test program that
		 * creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and invokes
		 * their toString() methods.
